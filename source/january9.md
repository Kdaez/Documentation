## Programming

### Brianna's Group

Today, our goal was to drive within range of and align to an April tag using a tank drivebase. We began with a code review with a mentor and then merged our testbench code with the main repository: ChargedUp2023. We then referred to PhotonVision documentation to implement an aim at target method. This method used a PID loop with the error being the yaw difference between the target and limelight.
